The buttons use our primary color to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a purpose:

- The light buttons are to draw attention on a dark area. Getting you to buy the product or attract you to.
- The regular buttons are for the cards and sections where the background might be a light color and you want to seperate the button from the site.
- The ghost button is for banners or something were you want to see the image though.

Buttons and font-size can change depending on the site.
